# Bin-Packing-Problem
Study of the variants and approaches to the Bin Packing Problem

The Bin Packing Problem (BPP) is a classical combinatorial optimisation problem with wide-ranging applications in logistics, memory allocation and manufacturing. This report presents an empirical study of different solver-based approaches for solving BPP in one, two and three dimensions using mathematical programming techniques. The performance of three solvers- CBC, Minotaur and SCIP were evaluated and compared using the Pyomo modeling environment and PySCIPOpt. An interactive Excel-based solver integrated with visualisations was developed, offering an intuitive and user-friendly method for experimenting with 1D and 2D bin packing instances. Furthermore, potential enhancements to the Minotaur solver were explored by proposing domain-specific cut generation strategies aimed at improving its efficiency on mixed-integer programs. This work bridges practical usability with theory and contributes towards accessible and scalable BPP solutions.
